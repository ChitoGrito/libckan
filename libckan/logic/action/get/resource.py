def resource_search(client=client.Client(), query='', fields='', order_by='', offset='', limit=''):
    """
    
    Searches for resources satisfying a given search criteria.

    It returns a dictionary with 2 fields: ``count`` and ``results``.  The
    ``count`` field contains the total number of Resources found without the
    limit or query parameters having an effect.  The ``results`` field is a
    list of dictized Resource objects.

    The 'query' parameter is a required field.  It is a string of the form
    ``{field}:{term}`` or a list of strings, each of the same form.  Within
    each string, ``{field}`` is a field or extra field on the Resource domain
    object.

    If ``{field}`` is ``"hash"``, then an attempt is made to match the
    `{term}` as a *prefix* of the ``Resource.hash`` field.

    If ``{field}`` is an extra field, then an attempt is made to match against
    the extra fields stored against the Resource.

    Note: The search is limited to search against extra fields declared in
    the config setting ``ckan.extra_resource_fields``.

    Note: Due to a Resource's extra fields being stored as a json blob, the
    match is made against the json string representation.  As such, false
    positives may occur:

    If the search criteria is: ::

        query = "field1:term1"

    Then a json blob with the string representation of: ::

        {"field1": "foo", "field2": "term1"}

    will match the search criteria!  This is a known short-coming of this
    approach.

    All matches are made ignoring case; and apart from the ``"hash"`` field,
    a term matches if it is a substring of the field's value.

    Finally, when specifying more than one search criteria, the criteria are
    AND-ed together.

    The ``order`` parameter is used to control the ordering of the results.
    Currently only ordering one field is available, and in ascending order
    only.

    The ``fields`` parameter is deprecated as it is not compatible with calling
    this action with a GET request to the action API.

    The context may contain a flag, `search_query`, which if True will make
    this action behave as if being used by the internal search api.  ie - the
    results will not be dictized, and SearchErrors are thrown for bad search
    queries (rather than ValidationErrors).
